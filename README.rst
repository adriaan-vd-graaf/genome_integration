Forthcoming.
This is more than certainly not a comprehensive README. Please contact the author if there are problems.
But really, you should not be using it in any way if you are not confidennt in changing the code itself.
There WILL be A LOT of bugs.

Requirements:

python >= 3.5
with
numpy, scipy installed.

gcta64 and plink should be in your PATH as the subprocess module will directly refer to them.

Gonna make this more comprehensive, stay tuned.
